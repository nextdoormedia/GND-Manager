# üè° Housemate Ryker: The GuysNextDoor Community Manager

**Housemate Ryker** is a custom-built Discord bot designed exclusively for the GuysNextDoor community. Its primary function is to serve as a reliable, **always-on moderator and administrator utility**, automating essential tasks to ensure a stable, safe, and clean environment.

This bot is engineered for guaranteed **24/7 uptime** using a **Web Service** hosting model (via Flask/Gunicorn). This deployment method prevents the unpredictable "sleeping bot" and connection drop issues common on basic free hosting platforms, ensuring Ryker is always home and ready to manage the neighborhood.
