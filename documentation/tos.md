# ðŸ“œ Terms of Service: Neighborhood Rules (Updated)

Effective Date: September 27, 2025

Welcome to the GuysNextDoor (GND) Platforms (website, streams, and Discord)! By accessing or using any of our services, you agree to these simple rules.

## 1. Mandatory Rule: You Must Be 18+

This is the most critical rule. All users of GND Platforms **must be 18 years of age or older.**

* **Your Confirmation:** By continuing to use our services, you confirm that you meet this age requirement.
* **Discord Verification:** For the Discord server, reacting with the **âœ…** emoji to the rules message confirms your acceptance of this ToS.
* **Violations:** If you are found to be underage, your access to all platforms will be immediately and permanently revoked.

## 2. Protecting Our Content (Copyright)

Everything Eric & Caleb create is our protected property (GND Content).

* **No Sharing or Copying:** You are strictly prohibited from downloading, screen-capturing, recording, selling, or sharing any part of the GND Content without written permission.
* **Consequences:** Unauthorized sharing is a violation of this agreement and will lead to an immediate, permanent ban.

## 3. Good Neighborhood Conduct

We expect everyone to contribute positively to the community environment.

* **Be Respectful:** No targeted harassment, hate speech, doxxing, or discrimination against anyone.
* **Illegal Content:** Sharing content depicting illegal acts or non-consensual material is strictly prohibited everywhere. **NOTE:** While content filters may be disabled in Age-Restricted channels, this rule against illegal material is **always enforced**.
* **Disciplinary Logging & Enforcement:** All moderation actions are **permanently logged** (via Housemate Ryker) for accountability. Users who receive a permanent ban are subject to **automatic re-ban** enforcement if they attempt to rejoin the server.
* **Confidential Reporting:** You are encouraged to use the `!report` command to privately report rule-breakers to staff. Abuse of the reporting system to harass others is a violation of this ToS.
* **Self-Promotion:** All promotional links must be kept in the designated `#self-promo` channel.
* **Owners Have Final Say:** The GuysNextDoor team has the final word on rule enforcement (warnings, mutes, or permanent bans).

## 4. Legal Protection (Disclaimer)

* **"AS IS" Service:** The platforms are provided exactly "as is," without guarantees that they will always be perfect or error-free.
* **Limited Liability:** You use these platforms at your own risk. The owners are not responsible for any content posted by other users or for any damages resulting from your use of the platforms.
